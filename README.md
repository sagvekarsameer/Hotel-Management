# Hotel-Taj (Hotel Management Project)

## üìå Project Overview

Hotel-Taj is a web-based hotel management system developed using **Advanced Java (JSP, Servlets)** as part of our academic coursework.
The application streamlines booking processes, staff coordination, and administrative controls to provide an efficient hotel management experience for administrators, staff, and customers.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sagvekarsameer/Hotel-Management.git

# How to run   
Open the project using IntelliJ IDEA.

Configure Apache Tomcat server in the IDE.

Setup MySQL using XAMPP and import the required SQL schema.

Run both modules (admin_hotel_taj and hotel_taj) by deploying them on Tomcat.

Note: This project uses Maven Archetype, not a standalone WAR file.

We successfully developed a working hotel management system simulating real-world use cases. 
The project enhanced our understanding of Java web technologies and team collaboration in a distributed development environment.
